# finalProject

Project Description:
Our project is a simple, retro version of the Legend of Zelda. The user travels four maps as Link and fights monsters  to save the princess, Zelda.

Directions to Compile/Run:
Since the project was done in processing, all you have to do is click the play button. The file/game will be called Game.

Directions for Use:
You must collect the Triforce of Wisdom before moving onto the next level. To move, click the arrow keys. The space key is for atacking. 

Note: There is some serious lag in relation to the monsters at the moment, so it doesn't work completely as intended.
